# Requirements
In this course we will use the following programs for various practical exercises:
- [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/getting-started-cisco-packet-tracer?courseLang=en-US) is a network simulation and visualization tool from Cisco. It allows you to practice networking without any hardware.
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) lets you inspect network traffic in detail. We will use it to see how the theory that we learn is implemented in the real world.
- [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is a program for windows which we will use to connect to and configure our networking devices (switch and router).

# Install Cisco Packet Tracer
1. Download the [Cisco Packet Tracer installer](https://www.netacad.com/resources/lab-downloads?courseLang=en-US) (version 8.2.2). You will have to log into your Cisco Networking Academy account to download it (check canvas announcements for a signup link).
2. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
3. Open Cisco Packet Tracer
4. It will ask you **Would you like to run multi-user when the application starts?**. Click **No**.
5. You may get a security message, such as Windows Security Alert. Some advanced features, such as multi-user Packet Tracer, require network access. However, if you prefer, you can turn off private and public network access.
6. The Cisco Packet Tracer Login window opens. Notice the toggle that allows you to Keep me logged in (for 3 months). If you would prefer not to log in each time Packet Tracer opens, click the toggle if you are not on a public or shared computer.
7. Click **Skills For All**
8. If your web session with Skills For All is recent, a web browser tab will open with the message: **You have successfully logged in to Cisco Packet Tracer.** You may close this tab. Close the tab and return to Packet Tracer.
9. If your session has expired, a web browser tab will open for you to log back into Skills For All. Enter your credentials to login. The web browser tab will now display the message: **You have successfully logged in to Cisco Packet Tracer. You may close this tab.**
10. If necessary, return to Packet Tracer. You are now ready to explore its features.
