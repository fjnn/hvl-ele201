Welcome to the practice section of the website. As part of this course you should have gotten a Cisco Networking Acadamy (netacad) account. A lot of the exercises you will be doing throughout this course will be on there. At the end of each lecture notes page, there will be links to relevant exercises. This part of the website is for shareing with you any exercises or assignments which are not on netacad and other topics, tips and trick which could be helpful during practice.
