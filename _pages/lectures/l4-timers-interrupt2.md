# Binary operations
## The Basics: Bits, Bytes, and Hexadecimal
Before we start, let's quickly review the building blocks:

- **Bit:** The smallest unit of data, either a 0 or a 1.
- **Byte:** A group of 8 bits.
- **Nibble:** A group of 4 bits (half a byte).
- **Word:** The natural unit of data used by a particular processor. For the STM32F767 (a 32-bit microcontroller), a word is typically 32 bits (4 bytes).
- **Hexadecimal (Hex):** A base-16 number system often used to represent binary data concisely. Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. You will frequently see hexadecimal numbers when dealing with STM32F767 registers (e.g., GPIOA->ODR = 0x01;). It's much more readable than a long string of binary digits.

## Addition, subtraction and compliment
Adding two 4-bit numbers:
```c
  0101 (5 in decimal)
+ 0011 (3 in decimal)
------
  1000 (8 in decimal)
```
Subtracting two 4-bit numbers:
```c
  1010 (10 in decimal)
- 0011 (3 in decimal)
------
  0111 (7 in decimal)
```
1's compliment: Convert the bit to its opposite.
```c
Number: 0101
One's Complement: 1010
```
2's compliment: Two's complement is the most common method for representing signed integers in computers, including the STM32F767.
To find the two's complement:
  1. Find the one's complement.
  2. Add 1 to the one's complement.

Example: Find the two's complement of 0101 (positive 5):
```c
1. One's complement: 1010
2. Add 1: 1010 + 1 = 1011
```

So, **1011 represents -5** in a 4-bit two's complement system.

## Bitshift operators

**Left Shift (<<)** Shifts bits to the left, filling vacant positions with 0s. Each left shift is equivalent to multiplying by 2.

```c
Example: 0001 << 2
0001 (1 decimal)
0010 (2 decimal, after 1st shift)
0100 (4 decimal, after 2nd shift)
```

We use left shift operator when we create bit masks:
```c
// Enable clock for GPIOA in the RCC AHB1ENR register
// GPIOAEN is bit 0 in AHB1ENR
RCC->AHB1ENR |= (1 << 0);
```
One can also use left shift to multiply a number by 2:
```c
uint32_t value = 10;
value = value << 2; // value becomes 40 (10 * 2^2)
```

**Right Shift (>>)** Shifts bits to the right. For unsigned numbers, 0s are typically shifted in from the left. For signed numbers, the sign bit is usually replicated (arithmetic right shift) to preserve the sign.

```c
Example: 0100 >> 2
0100 (4 decimal)
0010 (2 decimal, after 1st shift)
0001 (1 decimal, after 2nd shift)
```
We use right shift to extract bit fields, but it is not as often used as left shift:
```c
// Assuming a 32-bit register where bits 8-10 represent a value
uint32_t register_value = some_register;
uint32_t extracted_value = (register_value >> 8) & 0x07; // 0x07 is 0b111 mask for 3 bits
```
One can also use right shift to divide a number by 2:
```c
uint32_t value = 40;
value = value >> 2; // value becomes 10 (40 / 2^2)
```

## Binary operators
**Bitwise AND(&)**

AND operator is the same as you know from introduction to programming and/or digital electronic courses. However in microcontrollers AND operator has two particular usages: Clearing a specific bit and checking if a pin is set.

First remember the truth table of AND:
Here is the truth table for the AND operator:

| A | B | A & B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |   1   |

The result is only 1 if **both** A and B are 1; otherwise, the result is 0.
How do we *clear bits* using AND operator? We use & with a mask to clear (set to 0) specific bits while leaving others unchanged: `REG &= ~(1 << bit_position)`
```c
// Clear bit 0 (PA0) of GPIOA->ODR register
// To turn off an LED connected to PA0
GPIOA->ODR &= ~(1 << 0); // (1 << 0) creates 0b000...0001
                         // ~(1 << 0) creates 0b111...1110 (all bits set except bit 0)
```
How do we check id a bit is set?
```c
// Check if bit 5 (PA5) of GPIOA->IDR register is set
if (GPIOA->IDR & (1 << 5)) {
    // PA5 is high
}
```
**Bitwise OR(|)**

OR operator is the same as you know from introduction to programming and/or digital electronic courses. However in microcontrollers OR operator has a particular usage: Setting a specific bit and checking if a pin is set.

First remember the truth table of AND:
Here is the truth table for the AND operator:

| A | B | A &#124; B |
|---|---|---------|
| 0 | 0 |   0     |
| 0 | 1 |   1     |
| 1 | 0 |   1     |
| 1 | 1 |   1     |

The result is 1 if **either** A or B is 1; otherwise, the result is 0.

We use | with a mask to set (set to 1) specific bits while leaving others unchanged: `REG |= (1 << bit_position)`
```c
// Set bit 0 (PA0) of GPIOA->ODR register
// To turn on an LED connected to PA0
GPIOA->ODR |= (1 << 0); // (1 << 0) creates 0b000...0001
```

So by using OR and AND operators, we manipulate registers:
```c
// Configure PA5 as output (assuming MODER is a 2-bit field)
// MODER5[1:0] = 01 (General purpose output mode)
// This example is simplified; actual register manipulation involves masks.
GPIOA->MODER |= (1 << (5 * 2)); // Sets MODER5[0]
GPIOA->MODER &= ~(1 << (5 * 2 + 1)); // Clears MODER5[1]
```

**Bitwise XOR(^)**

The bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator returns 1 if the corresponding bits are different. 
Here is the truth table for the XOR (exclusive OR) operator:

| A | B | A ^ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |   0   |

The result is 1 if **A and B are different**; otherwise, the result is 0.

In microcontrollers, we use XOR to toggle a bit.

```c
// Toggle bit 0 (PA0) of GPIOA->ODR register
// To blink an LED connected to PA0
GPIOA->ODR ^= (1 << 0);
```

# Edge detection
When reading a digital input it is often desirable to determine the instant it is changing, and how it is changing. I.e. whether it is a rising, or a falling edge. There are several approaches we can take to solve this problem, but in this section we focus on solutions involving the sampling of the digital input. I.e. we are continuously checking the state of the digital input with a certain time interval. This approach is fine for slowly changing signals such as push buttons. Actually it is not only fine, it is often the recommended way to deal with slow signals.

In order to detect the rising edge of a digital input by the sampling method, we continuously compare the current state of the input, to the state at the previous iteration (the previous time we checked it). If the previous value was low, and the current value is high, we have a rising edge. The same logic can be applied it the reverse direction to detect the falling edge.
![rising_and_falling_edge]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/rising_and_falling_edge.png)

The following pseudocode illustrates the typical way one detects a rising edge in software:

```c
if(button_state != button_previous_state){
    // Code to execute when the state of the button changes can be placed here

    if(button_state == PRESSED){
        // Code to execute on rising edge can be placed here
        // I.e. state has both changed and is high, this can
        // only happen if the state used to be low, and just
        // became high. In other words it must be a rising edge.l
    }
}
```

# Understanding Pull-up/ Pull-down resistors
Letâ€™s think about what happens when you press a button.

![switchFailure]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/switchFailure.png)

As already discussed in terms of push buttons, when using digital inputs it is often required to add resistors to either pull up, or pull down the potential at the input. This is required because the input impedance of the digital input is very high, and the state may change randomly if it is not forced to a known state. For our convenience the STM32CubeMX allows us easy configuration. Alternatively you may add external resistors.

The size of the resistors is not critical, but it should not be selected on random either. A to small resistor may cause excessive current, while a to large resistor will defeat the purpose of trying to pull towards a given potential. I.e. the resistor value should be far away from the value of the input impedance. In practice a 10k resistor is often used, but both 5k and 50k will also work.

![Pull-up-and-Pull-down-Resistor]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Pull-up-and-Pull-down-Resistor.png)
Source: [circuitdigest.com](https://circuitdigest.com/tutorial/pull-up-and-pull-down-resistor)

The following figure depicts the connection of two push buttons to the Arduino (another development board but the concept is the same). For the leftmost button the resistor in the figure pulls the input low, and the push button is connected in such a way that it can pull it up. For the button to the right the configuration is opposite.

![arduino_two_pb_pull_up_pull_down_bb]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/arduino_two_pb_pull_up_pull_down_bb.png)

It is very important to realize that the default state of a digital input depends on whether the input is pulled up, or pulled down. If the input is pulled down by a resistor, and the push button pulls it up, then a push on the button will make the input logical HIGH. If on the other hand the input is pulled up by a resistor, and a push on the button pulls it down, pushing the button will make the input logical LOW

It is not important which of the two you choose, because it is easy to invert the state in software. But it is important to realize the difference, in order to know when you have to invert it in software.


# Debouncing
A mechanical switch will often generate spurious open/close transitions in a short period after it has been activated. It is a risk that these spurious transitions are interpreted as multiple signals from the switch. In order to avoid these problems some form of debounce remedy should be applied. This could be a hardware solution, a software solution or a combination of the two.

The graph to the right in the following figure illustrates the spurious changes in voltage level at the node between the resistor and the switch.

![switch_bounce]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/switch_bounce.png)

## Exercise: Bounce problem with external interrupts
TODO
Check timer register

## Hardware debounce methods
Hardware solutions include analog filters using resistors and capacitors, or digital circuits as illustrated in the following figure:

![Shift-register_and_a_nand_gate_as_a_debouncer]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Shift-register_and_a_nand_gate_as_a_debouncer.png)
Source: [e-thinkers.com](https://www.e-tinkers.com/2021/05/the-simplest-button-debounce-solution/)

The button state is clocked in to the d flip-flops, and only when all the flip-flops have registered the same state the output will change. This solution is typically found in programmable logic, but it is rather expensive to realise by using discrete components.

A really efficient and reliable debounce circuit can be built bu using a SR-latch in conjunction with a SPDT switch. In one position the switch is connected to the set input, while the other position of the switch is connected to reset input of the latch. That way you do not have to consider the time you expect the bouncing to last, or the duration between each of the spurious voltage pulses.

## Software debounce methods
If a software debounce solution is desired, one possibility is to check the button state twice, within a short time windows. I.e. check, delay, check again. The following source code listing illustrates one possibility:

Note that the variables are declared static inside the loop() function. This ensures that the value is persistent between the invocation of the function. Alternatively they could be declared globally, i.e. outside of any function definition.

## Key Considerations in interrupt usage
- **Keep ISRs Short and Fast:** This is the most crucial rule for any interrupt handler. Avoid:
  - Long delays (e.g., `HAL_Delay()`).
  - Complex calculations.
  - Blocking operations (e.g., waiting for peripherals).
  - Printing to serial (e.g., `printf`) if it's blocking.
  - If you have extensive work to do, set a flag in the ISR and handle the work in your main loop or a dedicated task (if using an RTOS).
- **Debouncing:** Buttons are mechanical and create electrical noise (bouncing) when pressed/released. Without debouncing, a single button press can trigger multiple interrupts. Implement either:
  - Hardware debouncing (RC circuit), or
  - Software debouncing (like the example above, or a more robust state machine).
- **Volatile Keyword:** If you use a global variable (like `last_button_press_time` or `button_pressed_flag`) that is modified inside an ISR and read elsewhere (e.g., in `main`), declare it as `volatile`. This tells the compiler not to optimize away reads/writes, ensuring the latest value is always used.
- **Interrupt Priority:** In STM32CubeMX, configure the NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) priority for your EXTI line. Higher priority interrupts can preempt lower priority ones.
- **Re-entrancy:** Be careful if your ISR modifies variables that are also accessed by the main loop or other ISRs. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (like briefly disabling interrupts, or using RTOS semaphores/mutexes) if necessary, but generally, keep it simple for GPIO toggling.

Any port, any pin, SOS exercise with button.

# Exercise (Home/Lab): Tilt sensor with LED blink
<!-- Look at some digital sensors, IR count maybe? -->
Make a project that your where you will blink two LEDs: one green one red. Additionally you will have a tilt sensor. As the project stays horizontal, a only green LED will blink at 2 Hz. As the project tilted, the only red LED will blink at 5 Hz.
1. You should figure our which pin numbers are connected to green and red LEDs using user manual.
  Alternatively, you can connect external LEDs.
2. You should choose an input pin as GPIO_Input for the tilt sensor.
3. Make sure the clock calculations are correct and you get desired blink frequencies.
