Installasjon og introduksjon til C++.


# Requirements
You need VScode, platformio, preferable STM32CubeMX.

# Install VSCode
TODO here

## Install PlatformIO extension
Platformio is an extension for VSCode that allows you to write microcontroller codes and send them to your device. We will be using STM32F767 Nucleo board in this course, but you can program many more microcontrollers including Arduino using this powerful extension.

TODO: Installation steps

# Install STM32CubeMX
This is an interactive GUI developed by STM to easily assign roles to your microcontroller pins as well as do fine time-related modifications before you start a new project. It generated a template code and it will be very useful later.
